# OIT Word Game

To use the game is simple! Once you download the file, open up your terminal. From there, navigate to the folder that you downloaded it to (If you downloaded it on Windows without specifying a location, chances are you'll just need to do the command cd Downloads)  
Before you start the game, make sure you have python installed, as well as the python libraries random and requests. You can download python online at their official site www.python.org. You can install the libraries most likely by typing 'pip install requests' and 'pip install random'
Then, start the game by typing either py, python, or python3 followed by a space and then WackyWords.py (eg. py WackyWords.py). From there, the game will give you instructions on how to play! Enjoy!
